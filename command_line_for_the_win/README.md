# Command Line for the Win

For this project, I completed the [Commandline Challenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/).
Each file is a PNG screenshot signifying my completion of all levels.

       * First challenge is to print "hello word"
       	 * **echo "hello world"**
       * Print the current working directory.
       	 * **pwd**
