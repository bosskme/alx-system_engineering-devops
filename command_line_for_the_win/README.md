For this project, I completed the [Commandline Challenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/).
Each file is a PNG screenshot signifying my completion of all levels.~

**First Challenge is to print “hello world” on the terminal in a single command**
	_echo "hello world"_
**Print the current working directory**
	_pwd_
